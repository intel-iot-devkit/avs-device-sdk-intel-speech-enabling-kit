 * This function converts a string representing time, encoded in the ISO-8601 format, to what is commonly

 *
 * For completeness, the expected format of the input string is as follows:
 *
 * YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+0000
 *
 * Where (in order of listing) :
 * Y means year
 * M means month
 * D means day
 * H means hour
 * M means minute
 * S means second
 *
 * So, for example:
 *
 * 1986-8-8T21:30:00+0000
 *
 * means the year 1986, August 8th, 9:30pm.
 *

 * @param[out] unixTime The converted time into Unix epoch time.
 * @return Whether the conversion was successful.
